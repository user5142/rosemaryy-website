Arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or similar arbitration organization. The arbitration will take place in Massachusetts, USA, and will be conducted in English.

These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and PlanPanda regarding the Service and supersede all prior agreements and understandings.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-16 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900">18. Governing Law</h2>
        <p class="mt-6">
